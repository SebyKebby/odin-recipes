    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I dont know... Shit tastes nice i guess.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Â¼ cups Italian-style tipo 00 flour, plus additional for dusting</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt</li>
        <li>Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating surrounding flour, until mixture is runny. Bring remaining flour into the mixture using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.</li>
        <li>Knead dough with your hands by flattening, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Take one piece and flatten it a bit with your hands. Dust a work surface with flour and roll dough out using a rolling pin 5 to 6 times. Turn dough 45 degrees and roll out again, 5 to 6 times. Keep rolling and turning in the same way until dough is evenly very thin. When you hold up the dough, you should be able to see your fingers through it.</li>
        <li>Cut pasta dough into rectangular sheets to fit your baking dish using a pastry wheel or a knife. Transfer lasagna sheets to a floured kitchen towel and let air-dry for about 30 minutes before assembling.</li>
    </ol>
